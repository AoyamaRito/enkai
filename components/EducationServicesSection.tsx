Okay, here's an "Education Services" section designed with the principles you've outlined in mind.  I'm going to use HTML and Tailwind CSS directly to demonstrate the core concepts.  This is a *single* HTML file, self-contained, and avoids external dependencies beyond the standard Tailwind CSS setup. I'll also include some inline styles for specific elements.

```html

Key points and explanations:

*   **Single File:**  The entire component is contained within a single HTML file.
*   **Minimal Dependencies:**  It uses Tailwind CSS via CDN and Font Awesome via CDN, which are considered acceptable "standards" in your context.  No custom JavaScript frameworks or build tools are required.
*   **Tailwind CSS:**  Styling is done entirely with Tailwind CSS classes.
*   **No Custom Hooks/Atoms/Utils:**  There are no custom hooks, shared utility functions, or external state management libraries.  Everything is self-contained.
*   **Readability and AI Friendliness:**  The code is formatted for clarity.  An AI should be able to easily parse and understand the structure and styling.
*   **Clear Structure:**  The HTML structure uses semantic elements like `<section>`, `<div>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, and `<ul>` for better organization and accessibility.
*   **Icons:**  Font Awesome is used for the book and graduation cap icons.
*   **Professional Design:**  The Tailwind CSS classes provide a clean and modern design with attention to spacing, typography, and color palette.  Hover effects add interactivity.
*   **Responsiveness:**  The `grid` and `md:`, `lg:` prefixes in Tailwind CSS make the layout responsive to different screen sizes.

**How it aligns with your principles:**

*   **1 File = 1 Complete Feature:**  The entire "Education Services" section is within this single file.  It's a standalone component.
*   **External Dependency Minimization:**  Only Tailwind CSS and Font Awesome are used via CDN.
*   **Duplication is OK:**  If you needed similar styling or components elsewhere, you would copy and paste the relevant HTML/Tailwind CSS instead of creating shared components or utility functions.
*   **AI Understandability:**  The HTML structure and Tailwind CSS classes are straightforward, making it easy for an AI to understand the component's purpose and styling.
*   **Focused Modification:**  If you wanted to change the color of the "Learn More" button, you would directly modify the Tailwind CSS classes associated with that button *within this file*.  No need to search for shared styles or components.

**How to use this:**

1.  Save the code as an HTML file (e.g., `education.html`).
2.  Open the file in your web browser.

This provides a solid foundation that adheres to your "AI-First" development principles.  Remember that the key is to prioritize simplicity, isolation, and AI-readability over traditional code reuse patterns.
